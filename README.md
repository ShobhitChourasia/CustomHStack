# CustomHStack

# What it contains:
1. Frame work to implement custom stack logic
  1.1It takes in array of views (held by viewControllers)
2. Handles collapse and expand view
3. Have deliberately added 2 buttons to demonstrate the pull up and pull down functionality.

# Known issues:
1. As of now, all the view controllers do not look similar to that in assignment but can be easily adjusted to look as it is.
2. For sample view controllers, it just contains dummy view controllers to depict the features in assignment, but due to lack of time, I was not able to do data passing and handle with actual viewModels.
3. One crash due to index out of bounds, but if I get some time, I should be able to handle this.
